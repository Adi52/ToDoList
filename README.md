# To do list
> This is a simple todo-list made with pure JavaScript.



## General info

This is my first standalone project made in pure javascript, html and css. Thanks to him, I understood many important concepts and used them in practice.
The motivation for doing it was from the Samurai Programming course on Udemy. In the future, I am planning to extend it with a backend (Django).
